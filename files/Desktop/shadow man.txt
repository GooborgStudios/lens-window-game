shadow man walks through a hallway

he sees a door, he walks through it.
this introduces the doors as a mechanic and the button used to enter them, also introduces movement


text file hint:
shadow man is trapped

shadow man needs 3 keys to be free

unlock 3 locks so shadow man can be free

shadowman knows the password


The "password" is white-on-white, you need shadow man to unblock it.

technically anything will work to reveal it but it's spread out, shadowman gives you a stable view.
or maybe not. maybe shadowman's presence activates the password for appearing for the sake of the reveal
