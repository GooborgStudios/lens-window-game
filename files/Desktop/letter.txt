Hello Hazel,

I see you're snooping around and breaking into my machines again. Don't worry, I'm not mad. I actually set this machine up just for you.

It's an old machine I pulled from my parent's attic. They certainly weren't using it for anything so I figured I'd stand it up and give it to you.

I figure this way you'll have something to do when I'm away, which I realize lately seem like it's more often than not.

It's running a super old operating system that's riddled with security issues.

Go nuts kiddo!

Love,
Adam
